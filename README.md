# r/place Amogus Finder

Finds amogus shapes on the r/place canvas.

Installs as a user extension (drag and drop folder into chrome://extensions - make sure to enable devmode)

These shapes are recognized by the extension.

# How to use

After installing it by dragging the folder into your chrome extensions, when visiting the r/place site (and expanding it) you'll see a new button at the top next to the coordinates that says "amogus finder" - when pressed your browser will lag and after 5-10s it will open a file in a new tab that has all among us characters highlighted.

# Why is it so bad?

This was written in one evening after a few glasses of wine and it's absolute garbage. I promise I usually write better code
